Assignment 4

Author Jose Molinari Blotta

Assignment 4 (10%) / Angular More
Create a new Angular project called yourLoginName-A4 / This mobile assignment will be graded in landscape view only.
See New Project-DefaultSetup for a review of how to start a new project with class defaults

Create a header component and a footer component
Use the styles.css to create global styles to share formatting in header and footer

Create a file in the app folder called yourLoginName.ts in the app folder. In this file, create a class called YourLoginName that includes the following definition with your choice of label and type:
Your student number, your name, your login name, your campus, and assignment title

In the root component .ts file, use a SERVICE to import a const that contains the class data with your information and use @Input to pass data from the app.component to the header and footer components.
Header area: assignment title / your name
Footer area: your name / your student number / your login name / your campus
Note: You may need to stop the node server and start up again after creating a class. Use Ctrl+C to terminate batch job then "ng serve" again after class file is created.

Create 3 JSON files: breakfast, lunch, dinner; Each will include at least 3 food items with name of food, price, and calories; Be sure to VALIDATE each JSON file.

Use Angular Material to create a tabbed view within a main comonent with menus for each of the JSON files. Use an Interface and Angular 7 JSON retrieval process to pull data in the app component and share with the main component.
How I will be grading exercise...

I will be using Chrome's Toggle Device Bar for iPhone 6/7/8 in Landscape mode using your submission URL
Remember, this is a mobile site so formatting and layout should reflect this; too much scrolling or whitespace will reduce your mark.
What to submit...

You will be submitting your cPanel or github URL to the comment area and a ZIP of your project's src folder in the SLATE dropbox
For help with publishing/deploying, see the AngularDeployment presentation under Module05 and cPanel setup under References Module

Each assignment must be done individually.
    I will be checking for copying especially if the assignments look similar and will file an academic integrity breach if necessary

This is not an assignment that should be started the day it is due.
    Since you have 2 weeks to complete the assignment, NO EXTENSIONS to the due date will be given.
